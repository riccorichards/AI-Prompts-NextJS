## Getting Started

# My Application (AI Prompt)

AI Prompt is a full-featured prompt-creation platform that leverages the power of Next.js and NextAuth for OAuth to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

## Features

- **Google OAuth Authentication**: Users can easily sign up and sign in using their Google accounts, thanks to the robust integration of NextAuth.

- **Prompt Management**: Authenticated users have the ability to:

  - **Create**: Users can create new prompts with associated tags.
  - **Update**: Users can update their existing prompts if they wish to make any changes.
  - **Delete**: If a user has the necessary permissions, they can remove their prompts from the platform.

- **Exploration and Search**:

  - **Browse Prompts**: All visitors, without the need to sign in, can view the list of prompts on the homepage.
  - **Advanced Search**: Users can search for prompts by the author's name, prompt's content, or tags. Clicking on a tag initiates a search for that tag.

- **User Profiles**:

  - Visitors and users can view profiles of other users to see the prompts they have created.
